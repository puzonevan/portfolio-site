There is a Method Test nav link for part 1 

Please go to [changelog.md](./changelog.md) for part 2

### Part 3
There is a Blog nav link on the [main page](https://cse134hw5-25a20.web.app). However, you can also directly view them [here](http://127.0.0.1:5500/html/blog.html). That link is where you can view them directly. In order to edit them, i created an admin.html located [here](http://127.0.0.1:5500/html/admin.html). Here is where the bulk of the firebase database CRUD is occuring. Add post button adds a new post to the database and pressing on the pencil does editing while the trash deletes. I did not have time to create a login system through firebase. Much apologies, I tried my best and could not figure it out.
